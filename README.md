# Algorithmics_class
Algorithms studied in Comp0066:
- main file allows us to run these functions
- Kruskal's algorithm (Mostly finished)
- Prim's Algo (Finished but needs work, since it does unecessary things)
- Graph Operations file contains a common function to process the adjacency matricies and other functions to clean up the code
